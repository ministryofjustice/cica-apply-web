Cica-Web is a front-facing web app that allows applicants to apply for compensation. Front-facing web app for the [Apply](https://claim-criminal-injuries-compensation.service.justice.gov.uk/apply/) service. A consumer of the [Data Capture Service API](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority/data-capture-service).

## Prerequisites

-   Windows machine running docker desktop.
-   You have Node Version Manager (NVM) installed globally. <sup>(_recommended, not required_)</sup>
-   You have NPM `">=9.5.0"` installed globally.
-   You have Node `">=22.8.0"` installed globally.
-   You have the Postgres `create-tables.sql` file in a sibling directory named `postgres-scripts` (this mapping is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file)

## Installing Cica-Web

Make sure that this repo is installed in a sibling directory to the Data Capture Service API. This directory structure is already configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file that are used to run the containers.

Clone the Cica-Web repo, and `npm install`

## Using Cica-Web

In order to fully run and use the web app, you will need to clone and install the [Data Capture Service API](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority/data-capture-service). The neccessary `docker-compose.yml` file is found in the dev-utilities repo.

This Docker Compose configuration will assume that there is a cica-web, and data-capture-service directory, both with the respective installed repos in them for it to run correctly.

> Full instructions on the required directory structure and configuration is found in the `Docker-compose-setup-for-CW,-DCS,-Postgres` Utilities Wiki article <sup>(_private repo_)</sup>.

To build and run the web app, run these commands:

-   `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev build`
-   `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev up`

Once it is built and running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/apply to use the web app.
